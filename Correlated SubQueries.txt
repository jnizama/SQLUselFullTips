Correlated Queries are subqueries where the inner querie has a reference to a column from the table in the outer query.

Example 1:
=======
SELECT categoryid, productid, productname, unitprice
FROM Production.Products AS P1
WHERE unitprice =
(SELECT MIN(unitprice)
FROM Production.Products AS P2
WHERE P2.categoryid = P1.categoryid);

Example 2:
=======
SELECT custid, companyname
FROM Sales.Customers AS C
WHERE EXISTS
(SELECT *
FROM Sales.Orders AS O
WHERE O.custid = C.custid
AND O.orderdate = '20070212');
